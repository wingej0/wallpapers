# My Personal Wallpapers Collection

A lot of Linux users, myself included, really enjoy having nice wallpapers on their systems.  This is my collection of wallpapers that I use on my machine and that I'm constantly adding to.

## Where did I get these?

I started by downloading Derek Taylor's (aka DistroTube) [repo hosted on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers) as a base, and I have added from there.  I use the program [Variety](https://github.com/varietywalls/variety) to fetch images from many different sources, and I favorite them into this repository.  I run a script (included) to rename them to numbers for a more streamlined experience. 

## Ownership

Most of these wallpapers either come from DT or from sites like Unsplash or Wallhaven (that I have queried through Variety).  Because of that, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will happily remove it.

Enjoy!
